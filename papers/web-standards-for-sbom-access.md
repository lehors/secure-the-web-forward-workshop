# Establish Standards to Support Web Access to SBOM Data

By [Gary O'Neall](#author).


## Description
Establishing a common vocabulary and protocol for accessing SBOM information over the public internet would ease integration into
various software build and deployment systems thereby improving overall software supply chain security.

Although this is a very ambitious goal, there is already a lot of standardization we can leverage for this purpose.

There is an existing [IETF draft proposal](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access)
to extend the Manufacturers Usage Description ([RFC 8520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8520)) to discover and retrieve SBOM information.
Although this proposal is focused on devices at the end of the supply chain, aspects of the model and approach could be leveraged for 
more general SBOM discovery scenarios.

For the SBOM vocabulary, the SPDX standard defines terms for supporting use cases involving SBOMs as well as many other supply chain relevant use cases.

The SPDX standard is a formal ISO standard ([ISO/IEC 5962:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html)) as well as an 
[RDF ontology](https://spdx.org/rdf/terms/) described in the [W3C OWL Ontology language](https://www.w3.org/OWL/).
The standard is also freely available as a [JSON schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/schemas/spdx-schema.json)
and more [human readable web pages](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/).

SPDX is supported and maintained by a large group of contributors representing tooling providers, SBOM producers and SBOM consumers.

The upcoming SPDX 3.0 has some very specific enhancements for making the SBOM information more web accessible.

Leveraging an existing well-defined vocabulary that supports standards ranging from JSON Schemas to full RDF Ontologies can accelerate
the adoption of internet accessible SBOM data and improve overall software supply chain security.
